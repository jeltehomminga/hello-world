# hello-world
just a new repo


Hi there creatures,

It's me, Jelte! I am following this GitHub guide how to:

Create and use a repository
Start and manage a new branch
Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
Open and merge a pull request

I'v done this before through a code editor before, but I was just curious how to do this directly online on GitHub. Seems simple :)
